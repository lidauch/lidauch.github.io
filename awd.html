				<h1 id="reflect">Reflective Essay</h1>
				<p>The intersection of Biology and Computer Science remains an emerging field, meaning that the communication between two previously unconnected disciplines rapidly increased. Trying to articulate biology principles to computer scientists and vice versa creates provides for an interesting, and often frustrating, dialogue. Written communication prevails as the most important skill both subjects share. Therefore, I believe that improving my own writing dexterity enables me to succeed in my field. Throughout the semester, Advanced Writing in the Disciplines provided me with valuable insight into my own writing skills. In reflecting on the course, I found three key areas where my communication proficiency progressed.</p>
				<p>The first of these categories came from Unit Three in which we wrote an article about a technical discourse but for a public, non-technical audience. In both computer science and biology, scientists often must write articles, documentation, and essays for people who have little to no understanding of technical details. While these pieces of literature can partially explain the techniques behind scientific findings, many readers do not have the background knowledge necessary for full explanations of research.  Consequently, in order for the scientific field to make an impact on the world, it must be able to engage the common reader in an interesting and analytical manner. Unit Three challenged my writing abilities because I often assume readers carry more knowledge than I should. I attempted to illustrate the implications of global warming in a world that is more crowded and more connected than ever before. By <a href="awd_examples/Unit3.FinalDraft.docx">writing a review</a> of Thomas Freidman's book <q>Hot, Flat, and Crowded</q>, I endeavored to inspire readers to think about consumption in a different way than the general media presents it. For example, when explaining the premise of the book, I used familiar language to describe daunting problems. I stated, <q>The book <q>Hot, Flat, and Crowded</q> explains that the world is not only flat &ndash; where few barriers exist between nations and individuals on an economic level &ndash; but it is also crowded due to the rising global population. The combination of the sheer number of people and the possibility for many more of those people to gain access to an <q>American</q> level of consumerism makes the world alarmingly hot.</q> Describing, scientifically, why the world temperature increases and by what mechanisms we calculate this rise is problematic. Writing for those who do not understand or have a background in the discipline, often provides a challenge yet if I keep in mind the question <q>why does this matter?</q> and continue wrap the scientific points in easy-to-understand statements and analogies, the burden of explanation decreases.</p>
				<p>This course also served to improve my revision my own, and other peoples', work. At the start of Advanced Writing in the Disciplines, revision club proved demanding. Finding constructive ways to point out peers mistakes and offer effective comments took time to learn. Additionally, assimilating multiple reviewers comments to enhance my work often took more time than expected. Determining which comments to accept and which to reject promoted my own awareness and appreciation of my works' shortcomings. In Unit One, my rough draft received the comment, <q>...this paragraph could use some sort of tie-in back to the main point. Why is it important that people can <q>do</q> rather than just observe? Adding a sentence at the end saying how the things mentioned in the paragraph make The Rust Programming Language more effective as a learning tool would go a long way.</q> This comment offered constructive feedback however, the second reviewer of my paper did not make the same suggestion. This left me to face the decision whether to accept my reviewers suggestion or to leave my paper in its original form. The comments of my reviewers, and especially the discrepancy in suggestions, forced me to take a second look at my own writing to determine the best course of action. Without the discussion brought forth from revision club, I would not have gone back to that section of my paper to improve its clarity.  Noticing how my reviewers comments impacted my work inspired me to continue providing supportive and energetic feedback. I especially focused on providing thorough <a href="awd_examples/rev_example.docx">letters at the end of my peers' rough drafts</a>. Maintaining a larger focus instead of providing preferential comments to individual sentences allowed for more comprehensive and intensive assessments. Making overarching comments, a such as the revision club work from Unit 1 shown in the supporting materials section, allows each writer to maintain his voice while still improving his communication. This course showed me the importance of subtle differences and how taking even just one more look at a composition can greatly improve a readers understanding of the discourse. In both Computer Science and Biology, almost all work is reviewed by at least additional person before publication or release. Therefore, knowing how to give and receive feedback is imperative to my field.</p>
				<p>A final area where my writing progressed was in synthesizing information from multiple sources into one document. Unit Four furnished many issues when I attempted to select the vital information from various scientific journals. Deciding what subsections to have in my literature review started the confusion. In a field as broad as Epigenetics, deciding what information to ignore proves half the battle. I discerned that, contrary to the assignment for Unit Three, providing adequate scientific detail laid the groundwork for the rest of the review paper.  However, this detail could not come from one source and required constructing intelligent knowledge out of many different origins. Even the data for one sentence needed the input of many experts such as when I stated, <q>The mechanisms of this type of regulation are still largely unknown however it is becoming increasingly evident that RNAi pathways and non-coding RNA's have a role in epigenetic states such as transmitting signals between two cells (Holliday, 2006; Tollervey & Lunyak, 2012)</q>. One statement called for the citation of multiple authors. Learning to recognize when publications reported agreeable or contradictory data helped me construct my literature review. The amount of information available in the scientific community is overwhelming at best. Yet, having the skills to sift through publications and amalgamate data into understanding deems itself necessary in todays' world.</p>
				<p>My experiences in Advanced Writing have allowed me to see tangible improvements in my writing dexterity.  The adaptation needed as a writer, to comply with and tailor to, different discourses is the most valuable insight I gained from this class experience. Being able to express myself to peers in my field, researchers in connected fields, and non-technical readers is imperative to my success as a scientist. I hope that my skills in writing will grant me the ability to bridge the gap even more between Computer Science and Biology.</p>
